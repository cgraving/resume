  As a Principal Architect at Ronin, I leverage my MS in Electrical Engineering and over 15 years of software
  engineering and architecture experience to design and implement cloud based micro services that utilize <mark>REST</mark>
  and streaming systems, such as <mark>Kafka</mark>, with containerized deployments using <mark>Kubernetes</mark> and <mark>Docker</mark>.

  I work with a technical team of software engineers and developers to bring a plan together and execute it, using
  <mark>Kotlin</mark>/<mark>Java</mark> and <mark>.NET</mark> languages and frameworks. I also have product and project level architecture experience,
  as well as project leadership experience, that help me deliver high-quality solutions that meet the needs and
  expectations of our clients and stakeholders. My mission is to add value and innovation to the software industry,
  while working on challenging and rewarding projects.

  Other Skills: <mark>Technical Design</mark>, <mark>SpringBoot</mark>, <mark>Git</mark>, <mark>Coding Standards</mark>, <mark>API</mark>, <mark>Streaming</mark>

          Lead Architecture Review Board to provide an architectural forum where challenges and possible
          solutions could be discussed and decisions made on how to proceed. In this meeting I was able to keep
          the group of managers and tech leads on track to come to a pragmatic, actionable plan.

          Lead Service Guild to provide microservice patterns, practices, and common tooling and code.
          This coupled with implementing these as shared libraries, common helm charts, and shared CI/CD
          workflows lead to a standardized service platform with minimal boilerplate code.

          Derived actionable technical requirements and technical design from complex product requirements that
          required working with many teams within engineering and data science to ensure the proper usage of
          the FHIR data from the medical systems.

          Mentor engineering teams on building technical designs and building scalable cloud solutions.

          Met weekly with Devops/Platform to ensure we are building and utilizing cloud infrastructure correctly
          and efficiently. Worked through establishing boundaries between services and platforms to have a clear
          understanding of how things should work together to maximize functionality and agility.

          Mentor engineering teams on building technical designs and building scalable cloud solutions.

          Lead designs of data pipelines utilizing Kafka, including building common libraries, implementing best
          practices.

          Lead and Developed features for secure document storage and service.

          Architect cloud solutions for applications and how those applications come together to form a complete
          solution.

          Work with our DevOps teams to implement a Kubernetes infrastructure to deliver our applications to
          production. With the migration to cloud-native applications and containerized deployment, we have
          worked to build up our best practices and infrastructure to automate the building of Docker images that
          then can get deployed into our Kubernetes cluster in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

          Provide architectural oversight for our Next Generation Omni channel contact center solution. This
          application leveraged Kafka Streams and was deployed into the OCI-based platform that was
          developed for microservices.

          Provide support for the product management team in business efforts to evolve our applications.
          Collaborated with VP product managers in Oracleâ€™s Identity solutions to establish if their solution would
          work for our application and what changes needed to be made.

          Teach and train all of the teams on microservice architecture, our microservice infrastructures, and
          Apache Kafka. Put together training materials and workshops that were presented to multiple offices
          around the world. Continued work with individual teams on their exact use cases and issues they face.

          Developed libraries and maintained an Inner-Source model for our software development teams to aid
          in the transition to microservices and leverage new components such as Kafka and Vault. Built this
          framework in Java, based on Jetty, Jersey, Spring, and Hystrix to help leverage Kafka as a streaming
          platform and pub/sub, event sourcing and CQRS patterns could be followed while still guaranteeing
          security between tenants in the multi-tenant environment.

          Worked on a system to act as an integration platform to be able to interface with many third-party ad
          servers through one common set of APIs. These APIs were written in java, utilizing spring framework,
          maven, and other common Java technologies. These APIs were both simple REST data APIs as well as
          some more complex functional APIs.

          Built REST and microservices in java, utilizing spring framework running a Tomcat web server. These
          services work together as a part of a global multi-datacenter, multi-tier data system, moving and
          processing large amounts of data in real-time. This system utilizes multiple storage mechanisms based
          on the data, use case, and location and availability requirements. For our large volume centralized
          datastore we are utilizing Apache Cassandra. Even though this holds multiple billion pieces of user
          data, lookups returned in 2 ms to the service. For our real-time, datacenter centric store we utilize
          Aerospike high-speed key-value store and its built-in replication. Kafka message queues are used
          extensively to keep individual services isolated. This isolation ensures all systems are very responsive
          without losing data. Redis, MySQL, Ehcache are all also used in appropriate capacities within the
          system.

          During my time as an engineer, a variety of tools such as git for version control, Atlassian products
          for agile planning, code reviews, GitHub for code reviews, managing pull requests, and Jenkins for
          continuous integration and build deployments. Amazon AWS systems such as EC2, Opsworks (using
          Chef), and S3.

          While working on the Oracle Service Cloud product, previously RightNow CX, I had the opportunity to
          work on the Agent Console component of our application. While the majority of this application is written
          in C# and .NET framework, I regularly interface with Linux servers and work with C, PHP, and MySQL
          systems.

          I managed a single employee and regularly led technical teams for specific projects. I was responsible
          for project design, implementation, and coordination for multiple projects per year. These projects
          ranged in size from 2 developers, to up to 18.

          Some of the key features I was directly involved with the development and design of were:
          * Desktop Workflow - A set of features used to build and run a customized workflow to guide agents
          through complex scenarios that could be encountered in service calls.
          * Agent Scripting - A set of features used to build and run a set of customized scripts to help the agent
          to know what to say to a caller on the service call.
          * Guided Assistance - A set of features that can be used to build and run a troubleshooter for either
          agents, or consumers from the service web pages.

          Microsoft WCF.

          Worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX for the front end.
